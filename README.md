# üëè Survey of Vision-and-Language Navigation 
This is the official repository of "**[Vision-and-Language Navigation Today and Tomorrow: A Survey in the Era of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07035)**", a comprehensive survey 
of recent progress in VLN with foundation models.

## Introduction
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has gained increasing attention over recent years and many approaches have emerged to advance their development. The remarkable achievements of foundation models have shaped the challenges and proposed methods for VLN research. In this survey, we provide a top-down review that adopts a principled framework for embodied planning and reasoning and emphasizes the current methods and future opportunities leveraging foundation models to address VLN challenges. We hope our in-depth discussions could provide valuable resources and insights: on the one hand, to document the progress and explore opportunities and potential roles for foundation models in this field, and on the other, to organize different challenges and solutions in VLN to foundation model researchers.
